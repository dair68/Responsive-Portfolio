        <p>
            I am an aspiring programmer currently studying applied math at UCLA.
            Topics I enjoy include computation, differential equations, and mathematical modeling.
            I love solving puzzles and taking on new challenges. I've made programs in C++, Java, and Python,
            and aim to add more languages to the list!
        </p>

            In my free time I like to play videogames and the piano. My favorite videogames include <em>Super
                Metroid</em>
            , <em>Shin Megami Tensei IV</em>, and <em>Nine Persons, Nine Hours, Nine Doors</em>. My favorite songs
            to play on the piano are "Lost in Thoughts All Alone" from <em>Fire Emblem Fates</em> and "Bluebird
            Lamentation"
            from <em>Virtue's Last Reward</em>. Nothing is more invigorating than slowly taming and mastering a
            formerly
            daunting piece.
        </p>

            Every day I'm always learning, always sharpening the mind. One day I hope to combine all
            my interests and create a simple game of my own, with original musical compositions and puzzles
            anyone can enjoy.
